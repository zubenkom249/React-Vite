# React + Vite

This template offers a simple setup to start working with React in Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a basic set of ESLint rules.

Currently, there are two official plugins available:

@vitejs/plugin-react utilizes Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc leverages SWC for Fast Refresh
Enhancing the ESLint setup

For production-ready applications, we suggest adopting TypeScript and activating type-aware linting rules. Take a look at the TypeScript template to seamlessly add TypeScript and typescript-eslint to your project.
